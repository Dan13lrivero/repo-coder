            <p class="text_biography">I’m Daniel Rivero, a Brazilian musician currently based in Uruguay, where I’ve been living for several years. Over the past eight years, I’ve had the opportunity to perform in various bands, touring not only across Uruguay but also in Argentina, Brazil, and Germany. One of the most memorable experiences in my career was representing Uruguay at the Wacken Open Air Festival in 2019, the biggest metal festival in the world.
                Throughout my journey, I’ve recorded several albums, EPs, and live sessions, and I’ve also contributed to numerous recordings. I’ve worked as a session musician on various projects and have been involved in forming bands for specific opportunities.
                I’ve had the honor of sharing the stage with some incredible bands, including Cannibal Corpse, Napalm Death, Brujería, Krisiun, Arde la Sangre, and many others that played at Wacken 2019. These experiences have helped me grow not just as a musician, but also as a collaborator in the global metal scene.</p>
